## Introduction
I believe it is important to preface this essay with the fact that I am a complete beginner with UI Frameworks and Bootstrap 5 and had no prior knowledge of anything HTML/CSS. The short story even shorter is that my feelings towards UI Frameworks is overwelmingly negative. But just as a brief explanation on why I believe I feel that way is due to the fact that I have no idea what I am doing and how things are not intuitive and frustrating.

## It's Just Not Intuitive
I think learning a completely new programming language would be much easier for me than it was just trying to learn the basics for Bootstrap 5. I mainly believe this to be true because I already have a solid understanding of coding, how it works, what it usually looks like, and can recognize and understand intuitively what it is that lines of code are doing. When learning a new programming language after having experience and knowledge of other languages beforehand, the main thing I usually need to worry about is syntax. This is an extremely easy problem to find a solution to and fix. I do not believe that any of this is the case for me when it came to UI Frameworks and Bootstrap 5. I did not have any foundational understanding of HTML/UI Frameworks. It is not (at least for me) intuitive and easy to understand what lines of code are doing when working with HTML/UI Frameworks. Not only do I not know what a lot of the main/useful pre-designed components and css classes are, I simply do no tknow what any of them do. The seemingly straightforward task of aligning elements or adjusting the spacing between them becomes just a game of trial and error for me while I'm left in complete mystery of anything I am writing and it's intended effect.

## It's Not All Bad
I do however recognize how UI Frameworks like Bootstrap 5 can streamline the process of web development if you already know what you are doing. It is very powerful in the right hands of someone who knows what they are doing and what they are working with. I simply am just not that person right now. Maybe in the future I will be, but messing around with Bootstrap 5 and trying to learn everything on my own is simply too much of a frustration to get me excited and motivated to do so, especially during crunch time.
