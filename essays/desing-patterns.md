## What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns refer to reusable solutions to common problems that occur during the design and development of software systems. These patterns include best practices, proven strategies, and general guidelines for designing flexible, scalable, and maintainable code. 

Design patterns provide a structured approach to solving specific design challenges, offering developers well-defined templates/blueprints to follow. They promote code reusability, modularization, and abstraction, leading to better software design in general.
