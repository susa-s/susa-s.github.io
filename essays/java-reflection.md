The first thing I would imagine everyone (except one friend of mine) would be thinking is, "What does 'One of the programming languages of all time' even mean?" The phrase most similar to this that I am sure everyone has heard before is "The Greatest of All Time". It sounds silly, I know, but it's how my friend and I like to describe things that are very obviously not the greatest, (i.e., if we were to describe a meal we had which was obviously not great, we would say something like *'that was one of the meals of all time'*). The humor is in not calling something the greatest of all time using that same format. So why isn't JavaScript the greatest of all time?

The answer may not be as deep or as exciting as some of you may have been hoping for, but truthfully, the answer is that I simply just do not know if JavaScript is the greatest programming language of all time. My current knowledge and experience with languages are so small that I feel it is almost undeserving of me to really share my opinion on if I thought JavaScript was the greatest of all time. There are so many other languages that I need to try, and so many languages out there that I want to try, and maybe then I can revisit this topic and officialy give JavaScript the "Greatest of All Time" award. 

## What About Right Now?

While JavaScript might not be the greatest, out of all the languages I have learned, JavaScript right now is currently my favorite. The language was super easy to learn and pick up the basics. Maybe this is due to the fact that I've already learned Java and C++ in the past that my current experience is a bit biased, but that's just how I truly feel. The language, to me at least, feels super streamlined and userfriendly. The syntax makes sense and is easy to understand, especially for beginners. Not needing to declare variable types makes the language feel extremely flexible. At a very basic level the language almost plugs and plays itself. Functions not needing one specific return type and being able to function as variables (also known as first-class functions) allows for us coders to be even more expressive in our implementations. Additionally, JavaScript is constantly getting new features added and is supported by a wonderful community.

Maybe one day in the future I'll come across a language I like even more than JavaScript, there are many languages out there that I haven't experienced after all. While JavaScript may not always be #1 to me, it's never a bad thing to get excited about and enjoy other things. So should the day come where I move on from JavaScript to a different language, I know for sure it'll be a great experience.
