## What is Software Engineering?

If you were to ask me what is software engineering or what is it that software engineers do, I probably could not give you a very great concrete answer. Is it just software design? Writing code for software and applications and building solutions for users? I'm not entirely sure. I'm hoping that by the end of this semester I'll have a much better understanding of software engineering, what it means, and what it is that software engineers do.

## Future Skills and Interests

Some of the skills and experience I'm always looking to acquire and inprove on include knowledge and proficiency in various programming languages. Gaining experience through collaborative projects within this course to further my effectiveness in working as a team, project managing, communicating, and other real-world applications. Gain the knowledge and experience to efficiently develop scalable software systems and solutions, and to develop a professional persona for myself. 

These skill sets and experiences heavily overlap with my interests in what I believe to be software engineering. At the very core of everything, I am simply interested in learning more. I want to learn more about many different programming languages. I want to learn more about how to effectivly work and communicate with a team in regards to software development, learn version control. I want to learn how to write better technical essays. I want to learn how to build large scale software systems, and how to be efficient in making those systems. 

I want to learn more about what software engineering means.
