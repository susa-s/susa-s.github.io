summary: "My High School Robotics team qualified for First Robotics Competition (FRC) worlds."
---

Starting my sophmore year of High School, I joined the school's robotics team. We would do a lot of great thing for Hawaii through our community service and volunteer work, but the best part about it was obviously the robots! We competed in three different categories: VEX, FTC, and FRC. My favorite would be FRC where we would have long workshop nights from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM every school day and just work on building a huge robot to compete in a game that gets changed every year.

The most notable year for me was 2019, which also happened to be my first exposure to coding. This year, our team bought LED strips and hooked it up to an aurduino to make our robot look cooler. I spent the entire 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM time learning how to code and messing around with the LED strips getting them to light up in different colors and different patterns. This was the most enjoyable day of the build season for me without a doubt.
