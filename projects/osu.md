summary: "I chose to make a simple recreation of one of my favorite games for my ICS 111 final project: osu!"
---

The final project for my ICS 111 class was to create a video game! At the time, my favorite game was 'osu!', so I figured, why not try to recreate it for my final project. The game is simple enough, simply click the circles to the rhythm. Without a doubt, this was the most fun I've had with programming, ever. I'd spend hours a day messing around with the code, seeing what changes would happen and trying to get things to work.

This was entirely a solo project and all the coding was done myself. We had two weeks to finish the assignment but with how excited and motivated I was to make this game, I had a submittable version finished within the first week. I spend the remainder of my time adding in new songs and generating circles to the rhythm.

What I learned from this project is that the amount of work and level of quality that you can produce when you're motivated and passionate about something is exponentially larger than the amount you would produce if you weren't motivated or passionate. I've found that I really enjoyed the process of creating this game and watching it come to life. osu! is something that I have always been passionate about, so it was super motivating and fun having that passion carry over into this project of recreating it.


## Video Demo
Here is a quick video demo of the game. Feel free to give it a watch.
