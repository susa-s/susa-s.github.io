summary: "I chose to make a simple recreation of one of my favorite games for my ICS 111 final project: osu!"
---

The final project for my ICS 111 class was to create a video game. My favorite game at the time was osu!. So I figured, why don't I try to recreate it for my final project. The game is simple enough, you simply click the circles to the rhythm. This was my most favorite project I've done so far. I've found that I really enjoyed the process of creating this game and watching it come to life. osu! is something that I have always been passionate about, so it was super motivating and fun having that passion carry over into this project of recreating it.
